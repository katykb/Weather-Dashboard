# Weather-Dashboard
This weather application uses two server side APIs from openweathermap.org.
https://api.openweathermap.org/data/2.5/onecall?
https://api.openweathermap.org/geo/1.0/direct?q

Two APIs were used to gather the necessary data to complete the project. The first API was used to get the location. Then, the location was used to 
get the the rest of the data for the current forecast and the 5 day forecast.

Languages used: HTML, CSS, JavaScript
Third-party APIs used: Materialize, MomentJS, jQuery

The application is live here: https://katykb.github.io/Weather-Dashboard/
